\textbf{Written proposals are limited to 2 pages of technical content and up
to 3 pages of appendix material that includes labor rates and hours, a
current CV, and a summary of related projects.
Selection of approximately 18 - 20 proposals will be based upon
participant experience, proposed approach, and time available.}


\subsection{Research Objectives}

\textbf{
\begin{enumerate}
%\item Formally describe and document UxAS architecture through an assume/guarantee framework
%\item Capture the high level goals, context, and verification evidence needed to construct assurance cases for UxAS
%\item Build a set of formalized high-level requirements for UxAS
%\item Use UxAS as a basis for formal high-level mission planning and decision making
\item Examine correctness of service implementations and tie to assume/guarantee framework
%\item Implement run-time assurance type architectures for services that are not easily verified
%\item Leverage the assume/guarantee interfaces to showcase modular design for reducing recertification effort (i.e. replacing a service with the same assume/guarantee behavior and showing correctness)
\item Analysis of systems consisting of mixed continuous and discrete dynamics (hybrid systems) by using reachability, falsification, or other verification approaches
\item \textcolor{red}{Construct a probabilistic model of subsystems and perform analysis using probabilistic model checking to determine robustness of components}
\item \textcolor{red}{Analyze system framework for security vulnerabilities}
\end{enumerate}}
