\subsection{Introduction}

%understand the problem?

We propose to address the challenges involved in the reachability
analysis of hybrid systems. Specefically, we are interested in
designing automatic falsification methods which can analyze black box
models of physical sub-systems (dynamical systems) against controller
code.

This problem is hard due to several reasons. Hybrid Systems are
difficult to analyze~\cite{henzinger1995s}. Traditional analysis methods~\cite{alur2000discrete,} involves
designing of abstractions.
Flowpipes~\cite{Chen2012taylor,
Frehse+Others/2011/SpaceEx, althoff2016combining,}
Furthermore, testing methodologies for
software controlled plants are lacking. Current indsutry practices
perform separate tests on the software and the plant. Although useful,
these strategies do not address the combined functional behavior.
Falsification~\cite{annpureddy2011s, donze2010breach}.
We
proposed a symbolic-numeric approach in~\cite{zutshi2016symbolic}
extending earlier approaches to falsification~\cite{majumdar2012clse}.

To improve the scalability (and time-horizon) of the approach, we
propose to use PWA moodels. PWA models can be automatically computed
Piece-Wise Affine (PWA) models for the plant, which can be composed
with control code and model checked using mature model
checkers~\cite{CBMC,}
The accuracy of the PWA models can be controlled by several parameters
including the discretization step $\Delta_t$, quantization function
$Q$ and number of samples.

%But it is not scalable?

involves the complex
interaction between software and physical world, but also missing
analysis for considering software artifacts along with plant models

    - security?


\subsection{Background and Challenges}

We are primarily interested analysing hybrid systems which result due
to the pairing of software controllers with continuous dynamical
systems. For analysis, we use the model of sampled data control
systems.

The challeneges are as follows
\textbf{Safety}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is there a behavior of the system which violates a given
        safety specification.
    \item Discovered violations must be reproducible. This entails a
        combined analysis of the software and physical model, as
        separate analysis will result in false positives.
    \item Ability to explore software artifacts which can lead to
        functional `bugs'.
    \item Symbolic approach is white box in nature and rigorous,
        whereas the numerical approach for hybrid dynamical sysems is
        scalable.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proposed Research}

We propose to address the safety and security analysis for control
system implementations. We now describe our model and assumptions.

\mypara{Sampled Data Control Model}
A \emph{sampled data control system} (SDCS) consists of two
components, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:clse}. (a) A
discrete time plant model $P$
%described by two functions $\simulate$ and $g$ as in Definition~\ref{def:plant_model}
, and (b) a controller implementation
$C$ described by a program whose semantics are formally defined.
%$\pgmF$ as in Definition~\ref{controller_model}.
Finally, the closed-loop parallel composition assumes that the
continuous plant has been discretized with the controller's sampling
period $\Delta_t$.

We are exploring relational PWA models of plants,
specifiaclly built for the purpose of reachability analysis.
Relational abstractions~\cite{Tiwari2012} and our previous
research~\cite{zutshi2012timed}

These
models can either be model checked directly using off-the-shelf SMT
solvers or combined with software controllers and model checked.
~\cite{Zutshi2016}.

Furthermore, we would like to explore models based on machine learning
due to the recent progress~\cite{pulina2012challenging,
pulina2011never, pulina2011checking} and~\cite{katz2017reluplex}.

\todo{falsification for security}

We also propose to extend the falsification framework to find attack
signals. We focus on the most general model where the sensor
can be compromised. The model also includes an intrusion detection
system, which further constraints on the attack signal, thereby
focusing the search for non-trivial attacks.
Using the same framework for search for exogenous disturbance, we
propose to find attack signals.

\subsection{Prior Work}

In our prior research, we have explored the problem of falsification
in hybrid systems from both the perspective of white box and black box
testing. In~\cite{Zutshi+Others/2013/Trajectory}, we explored the use
of multiple shooting for re-formulating the reachability decision
problem into the feasibility problem and solved using off-the-shelf
optimization engines. We then extended this approach to black box
testing~\cite{zutshi2014multiple} by combining multiple shooting with
a counter-example guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) procedure.
Finally, we combined symbolic analysis of programs with the analysis
of hybrid dynamical system and proposed a falsification approach for
sampled data control systems in~\cite{zutshi2016symbolic}. All the
above approaches were prototyped as tools and benchmarked on several
case studies.

% \subsection{Proposed Study}

% The Project Description should provide a clear statement of the work to be undertaken and must include: objectives for the period of the proposed work and expected significance; relation to longer-term goals of the PI's project; and relation to the present state of knowledge in the field, to work in progress by the PI under other support and to work in progress elsewhere.

% The Project Description should outline the general plan of work, including the broad design of activities to be undertaken, and, where appropriate, provide a clear description of experimental methods and procedures.  Proposers should address what they want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified. These issues apply to both the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.
